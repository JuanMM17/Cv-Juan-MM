<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am a seasoned Computer Systems Engineer with over six years of experience in delivering
comprehensive technical support. My expertise spans Service Desk operations within a Network
Operations Center (NOC) environment, as well as customer service, and both remote and on-site
support. I specialize in troubleshooting a wide range of technical issues, including software
malfunctions, hardware failures, network connectivity problems, and system performance
optimization. I have a proven track record of efficiently diagnosing and resolving incidents to
minimize downtime and ensure client satisfaction. I am recognized for my adaptability, assertive
communication, ability to work under pressure, problem-solving skills, and teamwork. I hold
certifications in Zoho CRM and Zoho Mail and have successfully led multiple onboardings in Zoho
CRM, Zoho Voice, and Zoho WorkPlace. Driven by a commitment to continuous improvement and
innovation, I am eager to engage in strategic projects that foster company growth.
